🔐 AWS IAM Best Practices – Summary Guide
📌 Overview
Are you a new user in the AWS Cloud and looking to understand how to manage identity and access securely?
This short guide highlights key best practices for using **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** — a crucial service that helps control **who is authenticated and authorized** to use AWS resources.
IAM is part of the **"Security in the Cloud"** responsibility under the [AWS Shared Responsibility Model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/). While AWS ensures the security *of* the cloud (e.g., hardware, infrastructure), it is the customer’s responsibility to secure what is *in* the cloud — like access, permissions, and resource usage.

🛡️ IAM Best Practices Checklist
1. **🔒 Avoid using the Root Account**
   - Only use it for initial account setup and secure it with MFA.
2. **👤 One Physical User = One IAM User**
   - Never share credentials across users. Each person should have their own IAM user account.
3. **👥 Use Groups to Assign Permissions**
   - Assign permissions to groups, not individual users. Add users to the appropriate group.
4. **🔐 Define a Strong Password Policy**
   - Enforce length, complexity, expiration, and reuse rules to increase account security.
5. **📱 Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Require MFA for root and IAM users to add an extra layer of protection.
6. **🧾 Use IAM Roles for Services or Cross-Account Access**
   - Instead of long-term credentials, use roles for secure temporary access.
7. **🛠️ Use Access Keys Only for Programmatic Access**
   - Never embed access keys in your code. Rotate them regularly.
8. **🕵️‍♀️ Regularly Audit IAM Usage**
   - Use tools like **IAM Credentials Report** and **IAM Access Advisor** to review account permissions and remove unused access.
